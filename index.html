    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Dhruv Kapse, a Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience, specializing in turning complex data into actionable insights. After completing my Master’s in Data Science from UT Dallas, I worked with Title 21 Health Solutions as a Business Analyst, where I optimized data processes and contributed to key business decisions. I later joined Safal Partners as a Data Analyst, where I focused on driving data-driven solutions and improving performance through analytics.

Known for my calm demeanor and out-of-the-box thinking, I approach challenges with creativity and a problem-solving mindset. I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful business outcomes and am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills in impactful ways.</p>
